excel-json-data
==========

This project simplifies json exports from excel files (xls, xlsx).

The motivation behind this tool was to create a rapid data prototyping
environment using excel.

Beside normal data dumping, you can provide metadata inside the workbook to modify how the excelsheets are exported. This allows you to cast, rename data up to build complex objects using relations.

Until i provide a proper readme please have a look into fileA.xlsx
to see what the tool is capable of.
